Differences:
 index tree is also implemented with B+ tree, not B tree.
   index tree utilizes InternalTableCell and LeafTableCell rather than InternalIndexCell and LeafIndexCell.
INDEX TREE == TABLE TREE 
    
       Index tree could only support dropping and inserting along with the table tree but not deleting due to complicity (implemented in DatabaseController).

    The key field of the table cells is implemented with type DBRecord, not int.


    The nodes of B+ Tree each has a pointer ParentPage pointing to its parent.
    leaf nodes of B+ Tree each has a pointer RightPage pointing to next leaf node on the right.
